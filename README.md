# EZMarket

This project is intended to simplify investing in the stock market and hopefully motivate the user to learn more, it's never too late to start but the sooner the better!
The website is focus to atract and keep new people into the investing world, a few years ago I was curious about investing and I started doing it but I had to stop because everything seem so complicated. When the pandemic hit last year I had more time to get into it more seriously and I discovered that is not that bad and I believe some stuff can be simplified
Some of the main features of this website would be to teach in simple words investment terms to help you start investing, and with the help of an investing API show you some charts and other cool functionalities that will make learning easy and interesting.
The project is being implemented in Angular 11 and Bootstrap, Firebase is being used for the database and the authentication.
